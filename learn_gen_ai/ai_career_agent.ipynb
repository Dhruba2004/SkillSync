    "üìå **Detailed Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Match Score (0‚Äì100):**\n",
    "   - Start at 100 and deduct based on gaps:\n",
    "     - Each missing **critical technical skill**: -5 to -10 points.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Missing Skills:**\n",
    "   - List **critical hard skills explicitly mentioned in JD but absent in resume**.\n",
    "   - Examples: Kubernetes, AWS Lambda, React, Terraform, Leadership, Stakeholder Management.\n",
    "   - Only include skills that are truly absent.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Partially Covered Skills:**\n",
    "   - List skills that are **similar/related but not exact matches**.\n",
    "   - Example: Resume has \"Azure Functions\" but JD asks \"AWS Lambda\".\n",
    "   - Example: Resume has \"CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions\" but JD asks \"Jenkins\".\n",
    "   - Helps candidate see near-misses they should emphasize or reframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Recommendations (actionable):**\n",
    "   - Always link directly to JD requirements.\n",
    "   - Categories:\n",
    "     - **Resume Edits:** Add missing keywords, rearrange sections, emphasize relevant projects.\n",
    "     - **Skill Development:** Suggest specific certifications, training, or side projects.\n",
    "     - **Experience Highlighting:** Recommend rephrasing existing experience to align with JD.\n",
    "   - Keep them **specific, realistic, and measurable** (not vague).\n",

    "5. **Feedback (short summary):**\n",
    "   - 2‚Äì4 sentences max.\n",
    "   - Tone: constructive + professional.\n",
    "   - Highlight strengths + weaknesses.\n",
